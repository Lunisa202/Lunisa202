I'm Peruvian. Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Peru, and fullstack developer. I have built web applications using Node.js, Express, Zod, Sequelize, JavaScript, React, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS, and tailwind CSS. I studied on platforms like [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [open-bootcamp](https://campus.open-bootcamp.com/), [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), youtube and others like [adventJs](https://adventjs.dev/es) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
I graduated from the ONE (Oracle Next Education) program as a frontend web programmer with React. After this, I have participated in 'No Country' and 'Foo Talent' work simulation projects. I have also developed projects as a freelancer.
