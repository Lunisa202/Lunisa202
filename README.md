# ✋Hello, I'm Mary Laura Carolina Limay Oliva

I'm Peruvian. I'm a self-taught web programming student and graduated from National University of Trujillo as computer engineering. I want to become a fullstack programmer 👩‍💻. Currently, I am learning Javascript, TypeScript with React and Java with SpringBoot, the knowledge I have is HTML, Javascript, CSS, Sass, tailwind, and Git. I studied on platforms like [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [open-bootcamp](https://campus.open-bootcamp.com/), [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), youtube and others like [adventJs](https://adventjs.dev/es) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
I graduated from the ONE (Oracle Next Education) program as a frontend web programmer with React. After this, I have participated in 'No Country' work simulation projects.
